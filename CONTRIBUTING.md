## How to write good issues

Always explain the conditions which led you to write this issue. 
Any reader must be able to understand your idea or reproduce a bug without having to ask for examples, use cases or sample-data.  

German language is preferred for issues + changelog because JTL primary addresses the german-speaking market

* Keep your issue titles short and descriptive
* Format your description with [Gitlab flavoured markdown](https://gitlab.jtl-software.de/help/markdown/markdown): Make use of syntax highlighting, lists, links and images



## Commit Messages

Always provide a short summary of your Codechange in the first line. 
Long description is optional. If needed, place a new line between summary and long description.  

Summary (first line): 

Provide a short description about the change and use words like "Improve, Fix, Add, Remove, Shorten, Update" e.g. to keep a good readability.


Issue References: 

End your commit message with "Fix" or "Re" or "Unfix" followed by the issue referenced. 
If your commit message is 1 line only, feel free to place your issue reference at the end of that line. 
Otherwise place a new line above the reference.

```
